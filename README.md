# BrighterDayBouquet
This is an e-commerce website for selling flowers to local customers (no delivery options planned for release)

I've run into some issues because I didn't quite understand what I was doing with AngularJS, so I'm
altering my approach. I'm going to first build the site using just ASP.NET Core to render the front end.
I'll then rebuild the site after it's finished, and I've solved most of the hard design problems, with AngularJS.
I may make the move to use Anguar2. I've not looked into it too much but I like the idea of componentization.

## Technologies Used:
### Backend:
  * ASP.NET Core 1.0.0 - Including:
    * MVC Core
    * Identity
    * Entity Framework Core for SQL Server
    
### Frontend:
  * Angular 1.x
  * Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.6
  * JQuery 3.x
    * JQuery-Validation
  * Font Awesome 4.x
