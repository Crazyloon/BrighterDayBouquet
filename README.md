# BrighterDayBouquet
This is an e-commerce website for selling flowers to local customers (no delivery options planned for release)

I plan to build this site for fun and to gain some experience using new technologies.
After I complete this version of the site, I will recreate it using AngularJS (possibly Angular2 - we'll see!)

## Technologies Used:
### Backend:
  * ASP.NET Core 1.0.0 - Including:
    * MVC Core
    * Identity
    * Entity Framework Core for SQL Server
    
### Frontend:
  * Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.6
  * JQuery 3.x
    * JQuery-Validation
  * Font Awesome 4.x
